## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- MySQL 8.0+
- Maven 3.8+
- JavaFX SDK (if not bundled)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HoopHub.git
   cd HoopHub
   ```

2. **Configure Database**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
   ```

3. **Update configuration**
    - Copy `src/main/resources/config/database.properties.example` to `database.properties`
    - Update with your MySQL credentials

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   **GUI Version:**
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

   **CLI Version:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/hoophub-cli.jar
   ```

## 🔍 CI/CD & Static Analysis

To ensure high code quality and automate testing, a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline has been implemented using **GitHub Actions** and **SonarCloud**.

### 1. Architectural Decisions
The analysis setup was customized to fit the specific needs of a JavaFX application:
* **Maven Configuration (`pom.xml`)**:
    * Defined project identity (`sonar.organization`, `sonar.projectKey`) directly in the build file for portability.
    * **Exclusions**: Configured explicit exclusions (`<sonar.exclusions>`) for CSS and FXML files. This was necessary to prevent valid JavaFX styling and markup from being flagged as "code smells" (false positives).
* **GitHub Actions (`build.yml`)**:
    * A workflow was created to automatically trigger the Maven build on every `push` to the main branch.
    * This ensures that the analysis runs in a controlled environment using Java 21, respecting the Maven exclusions that SonarCloud's native automatic analysis would ignore.

### 2. Viewing the Analysis

#### 🟢 Automatic (Live Dashboard)
Thanks to the CI pipeline, the code is analyzed automatically after every commit.
👉 **[View SonarCloud Dashboard](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=EliaCinti_HoopHub2)**

#### ⚙️ Manual (CLI)
To run a local analysis before pushing changes (e.g., for pre-commit checks), use the Maven Wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.token=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```
