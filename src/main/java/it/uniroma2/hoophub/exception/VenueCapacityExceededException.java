/**
 * Exception thrown when a venue's capacity would be exceeded by a booking request.
 * <p>
 * This exception is a specialized type of {@link BookingNotAllowedException} that provides
 * detailed information about capacity constraints. It allows the system to give users
 * specific feedback about why their booking cannot be accommodated, including exactly
 * how many seats were requested versus how many are actually available.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This exception is typically thrown by venue managers when attempting to confirm
 * a booking that would exceed the venue's maximum capacity for a given date.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The exception includes three key pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The name of the venue that cannot accommodate the request</li>
 *   <li>The number of seats that were requested</li>
 *   <li>The number of seats actually available</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * if (!venue.hasAvailableCapacity(gameDate, seatsRequested)) {
 *     throw new VenueCapacityExceededException(
 *         venue.getName(),
 *         seatsRequested,
 *         venue.getRemainingCapacity(gameDate)
 *     );
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
