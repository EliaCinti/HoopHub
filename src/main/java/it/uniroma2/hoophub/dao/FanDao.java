 * Data Access Object interface for Fan entities.

 * Implementations will provide specific logic for different storage mechanisms (e.g., CSV, MySQL).
 * The DAO handles conversion between Bean objects (for data transfer) and Model objects
 * (for business logic), including the reconstruction of relationships with other entities
 * like Bookings.
